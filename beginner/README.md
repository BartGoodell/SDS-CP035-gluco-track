# 🟢 GlucoTrack Beginner Track

Welcome to the **Beginner Track** of the GlucoTrack project! This track is designed for participants who want to build a strong foundation in supervised machine learning by predicting diabetes risk based on health and lifestyle indicators.

You'll work with a real-world dataset from the CDC and follow a full ML pipeline: from data cleaning and EDA to model deployment using Streamlit.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [CDC Diabetes Health Indicators](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators)
- **Goal**: Classify individuals as diabetic (`1`) or non-diabetic (`0`)
- **Features**: BMI, Age category, Physical/Mental Health Days, Smoking, General Health, etc.

## 🎓 Weekly Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Check for missing, duplicate, or invalid values
- Review column data types and formats
- Understand class balance of the target variable
- Visualize distributions, correlations, and feature-to-target patterns
- Document top 3–5 insights in your report

### ✅ Week 2: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

- Encode binary, ordinal, and nominal features appropriately
- Create new features (e.g., BMI categories, health scores)
- Handle data imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weights
- Normalize numerical features
- Split data using stratified train/validation/test sets

### ✅ Week 3: Model Development & Experimentation

- Train baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes
- Track experiments using MLflow
- Evaluate models on validation set with metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Perform error analysis using confusion matrices

### ✅ Week 4: Model Tuning & Finalization

- Perform hyperparameter tuning (grid/random search)
- Use cross-validation to validate model stability
- Finalize best model with full training set
- Evaluate on test set and interpret feature importance

### ✅ Week 5: Deployment

- Build a Streamlit app for model inference
- Design user-friendly form inputs
- Display prediction results and risk messages
- Deploy the app to Streamlit Community Cloud
