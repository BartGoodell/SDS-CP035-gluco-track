## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### üìä High-Level Overview

Our EDA process followed a systematic approach covering six major areas:
1. **Setup and Data Loading** - Dataset acquisition and initial inspection
2. **Data Integrity Assessment** - Missing values, duplicates, and format validation
3. **Univariate Analysis** - Individual feature distributions and quality
4. **Bivariate Analysis** - Feature relationships and correlations
5. **Target Variable Analysis** - Class distribution and imbalance assessment
6. **Modeling Preparation** - Preprocessing recommendations and next steps

### üîç Key Findings

**Dataset Quality:**
- **Excellent completeness:** Zero missing values across 253,680 samples
- **Data integrity issue:** 24,206 duplicate rows (9.5%) requiring removal
- **Proper encoding:** All variables appropriately formatted for analysis
- **Clinical relevance:** All 21 features medically meaningful for diabetes prediction

**Target Variable Insights:**
- **Class distribution:** 86.07% no diabetes, 13.93% diabetes/prediabetes
- **Significant imbalance:** 6.2:1 ratio requiring specialized handling techniques
- **Sample sufficiency:** 35,346 positive cases adequate for robust modeling

**Feature Characteristics:**
- **4 Numerical variables:** BMI, MentHlth, PhysHlth, Age with distinct distribution patterns
- **18 Categorical variables:** Binary health indicators properly encoded as 0/1
- **Low multicollinearity:** Only one strong correlation (GenHlth ‚Üî PhysHlth: 0.524)
- **Feature independence:** Most variables provide unique predictive information

**Health Pattern Discoveries:**
- **BMI distribution:** Population skews toward overweight/obese (mean ~28-30)
- **Health day patterns:** Mental and physical health metrics show survey response clustering
- **Comorbidity clustering:** Diabetes strongly associated with hypertension, high cholesterol, heart disease
- **Socioeconomic gradients:** Education and income inversely correlated with diabetes risk
- **Age progression:** Clear age-related increase in diabetes prevalence

**Notable Outliers and Patterns:**
- **BMI outliers:** Some extreme values >60 representing severely obese individuals (clinically meaningful)
- **Health days clustering:** Peaks at 0, 15, and 30 days indicating survey response patterns
- **Binary variable validation:** All categorical features properly encoded with no invalid entries
- **Healthcare access patterns:** Financial barriers to care strongly associated with diabetes risk

**Data Quality Issues Addressed:**
- **Duplicate detection:** Systematic identification of 24,206 duplicate records
- **Range validation:** No unrealistic values detected in any numerical features
- **Encoding verification:** All binary variables contain only valid 0/1 values
- **Data readiness score:** 3/4 (excellent foundation for modeling)
